He currently co-leads the Health Systems Policy in Practice module for the MSc in International Health and Tropical Medicine. Recently, he retired from the World Health Organization (WHO), where he served as a Program Officer in the Health Services Performance Assessment unit within the Integrated Health Services department. Dr. Horemans joined WHO in 2014 during the West African Ebola outbreak to aid in health system recovery efforts across the affected nations.\nHis expertise encompasses primary healthcare measurement, quality of care, health services resilience, and the convergence of health systems and health security, particularly in emergency situations and fragile, conflict-affected, and vulnerable settings. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Horemans played a pivotal role in leading WHO’s initiatives to assess national and global health service capacities through rapid frontline health facility assessments and the Global Pulse Surveys, which evaluated the continuity of essential health services.\nBefore his tenure at WHO headquarters, Dr. Horemans held various influential roles across different levels of the healthcare system. He served as a project manager and WHO senior health policy advisor for the Greek health system reform, and he worked as a project manager and health advisor in Cambodia and Lao PDR. Additionally, he was the co-director of the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali and served as the district medical officer and hospital director in Mwinilunga, a rural district in Zambia. As a consultant, he collaborated with multiple organizations, including BTC, EDF, GIZ, HIB, KFW, UNFPA, USAID, and the World Bank Group, assisting in the development of health sector plans and evaluations of health projects across Africa and Asia.\nDr. Horemans earned his medical degree from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, holds a Diploma in Public Health and Tropical Medicine from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, and a Master of Science in Public Health in Developing Countries from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine."

    "text": "I am a medical doctor and a graduate of the first 2015-2016 cohort of the Oxford MSc in International Health and Tropical Medicine. Since 2017 I have been a lecturer in the MSc IHTM and I am currently an IHTM Senior Teaching and Research Fellow and Lead of the Life Course sub-module.\nMy research interests span adolescent health, maternal health and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), using qualitative and participatory methods. During my IHTM placement project “Perceptions and experiences of adolescent pregnancy in refugee and migrant communities on the Thai-Myanmar border”, I had the opportunity to work with vulnerable adolescents in a fragile setting. More recently, I organised adolescent advisory groups in sub-Saharan Africa for the UKRI GCRF Accelerating Achievement for Africa’s Adolescents Research Hub, aiming to inform and align research priorities and linked services with adolescents’ priorities.\nTogether with colleagues I also dedicate time to research capacity sharing with organisations and institutions of IHTM alumni. In Liberia we collaborate with a team of early career Liberian researchers and IHTM alumni to generate locally relevant evidence, assess evidence gaps and identify research priorities in Maternal and Neonatal Health in Liberia (OMNeo Health). By invitation of colleagues in the Seychelles Ministry of Health, we are supporting the development of research skills of MoH project managers to inform health policies. We hope that these collaborations cause a ripple effect and will give rise to a sustainable transformation, in which local research with local data drives local policy and improves the health outcomes for vulnerable populations."

He is also an Associate Professor of Applied Philosophy at the Department of Philosophy and Classics at the University of Ghana and an affiliate Instructor at the University of Washington’s Department of Bioethics and Humanities. Caesar is also the President of the International Association of Bioethics (2024-2026).\nCaesar’s interests and research in bioethics are conceptual and empirical. On the former, he works around revisiting some of the underlying conceptual frameworks informing bioethics by drawing on philosophical ideas, African and non-African, that address inequity in the relationships that govern current approaches to global health with an eye to new ethical frontiers, decolonization, and pluriversality. In 2019, he co-edited a volume titled Bioethics in Africa, which discusses bioethical problems from an African perspective. He is currently leading a team of highly qualified colleagues from across the globe on a Wellcome Discovery Award to explore conceptualizations of solidarity and to design a solidarity index for ranking global health funders.\nAt the empirical level, he has designed a training package in clinical ethics for nursing trainees in Ghana based on real-life cases, served on IRBS, and contributed to the design and teaching of the first MSc in bioethics at the University of Ghana. He has led empirical research on conceptualizations and ethics of mental healthcare, especially in relation to persons who hold cultural and religious beliefs about the mind.\nCaesar is a member of the WHO’s Covid-19 Ethics and Governance Working Group, a member of the Steering Committee of the Global Forum for Bioethics in Research, a Board Member of the International Association of Bioethics, and a core member of the Africa CDC-linked Working Group on an African framework for research ethics during outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.\nOutside academic life, Caesar leads an NGO, Amicus Onlus, that operates in healthcare, basic education, vocational skills training, and re-integration of returned illegal migrants to Europe in Ghana. This NGO works mainly among rural communities and the underprivileged. This dimension informs and compliments Caesar’s philosophical commitment to a more ethical world."
